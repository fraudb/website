<h2>Welcome to FrauDB!</h2>
<p>FrauDB is a cooperative database which lists fraudulent individuals, identified by account details such as an email address or telephone number. The database works by only storing <strong>the SHA256 hash</strong> of any listed individual meaning that no personal data is actually stored. Participating members can then check a new user wishing to sign up for an account with them by SHA256 hashing their entered information and making a request to our APIs which will compare the information against our database. If the user passes the check they will be allowed to proceed. Now if that same user decides to start misusing the services that they have purchased with their account, the participating member can, again, hash their sign-up information and send it our way. We then manually review the listing based on the context of the submission and if approved the hashed information will be added to our database and tagged with the appropriate tag. The best part of this process is that no data is ever actually sent our way, only the hashed version of it, meaning that <strong>we never store any sensitive information whatsoever</strong>.</p>
<p>Because listings are tagged we can also seperate listings for e.g. hosting services from those for something like free social media accounts. This also gives our participating members the oppertunity to take on a potential customer,  despite being listed, because the listing reason won't always align with the goals of the other participating members. An example of this could be a participating member flagging one of their customers for wasting their support team's time, but that might not matter to a 2nd participating member who does not offer any support for their products to begin with.</p>
<p>FrauDB also acts as a neutral party, everyone who works on the project is a voluntary contributor and we release all the software behind the project on <a href="https://github.com/fraudb/core" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> for free.</p>
<h2>Participate</h2>
<p>The more organisations and projects involved with FrauDB, the better. If you would like to join us in preventing internet abuse around the globe by contributing the results of your own investigative activity and/or want to take advantage of the FOSS fraud checking system this project creates, please email us at <a href="mailto:join@fraudb.org" class="link">join@fraudb.org</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone can apply to become a member but for the greatest chance of getting approved you should consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you have a real-world use case for access to the database, e.g. have a website that requires background checking users, your application will likely be approved but on the grounds of your project's size.</li>
    <li>If you have data to contribute in exchange for the benefit you're receiving, your application is likely to be approved on the grounds of increasing the size of our database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>For end users</h2>
<p>If you believe you have been listed in FrauDB, you can search by a variety of parameters including the most common; email address and phone number. You can also combat any listing you may have, members cannot always be trusted to report accurate information to us and neither can they guarantee that there isn't another side to their story. As such we will <strong>usually</strong> not punish members for false listings but <strong>we always review every de-listing request</strong> in depth. De-listing requests are always reviewed in a maximum of three days and are actioned upon after a conclusion has been reached.</p>
